I have a PhD in Computer Science at [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es), supervised by Dr. Lluís Felip hurtado and Dr. Emilio Sanchis. My main interest is to develop computational models that understand and generate human language in the same way humans do. 

I mainly work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields such as summarization, affective analysis, and figurative language. Broadly interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning. I am always trying to boost research in NLP for Spanish and co-official languages in Spain.
