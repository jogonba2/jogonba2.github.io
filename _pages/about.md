I have a PhD in Computer Science at [*Universitat Politècnica de València*](https://www.upv.es), supervised by Dr. Lluís Felip hurtado and Dr. Emilio Sanchis under the umbrella of the [*Enginyeria del Llenguatge i Reconeixement de Formes*](http://elirf.upv.es) (*ELIRF*) research group in the [*Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence*](https://vrain.upv.es/) (*VRAIN*). I am currently working at [Symanto](https://www.symanto.com/).

My main interest is to develop computational models that understand and generate human language in the same way humans do. I mainly work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields such as summarization, affective analysis, and figurative language. Broadly interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning. I am always trying to boost research in NLP for Spanish and co-official languages in Spain.
