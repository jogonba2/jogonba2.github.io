I'm José, an NLP researcher deeply passionate about exploring the limitless possibilities of natural language processing. I did my PhD at the *Universitat Politècnica de València*](https://www.upv.es), supervised by Dr. Lluís Felip hurtado and Dr. Emilio Sanchis under the umbrella of the [*Enginyeria del Llenguatge i Reconeixement de Formes*](http://elirf.upv.es) (*ELIRF*) research group in the [*Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence*](https://vrain.upv.es/) (*VRAIN*). It focused on summarization and attention-based models, but my work spans a wide range of NLP topics, including: 📚 [Zero- and few-shot] Text Classification, 😊 Sentiment and Emotion Analysis, 🌟 Figurative Language Understanding, 🗣️ Dialogue Systems, 📄 Information Extraction, or 🤖 Machine-Generated Text Detection.

Since 2016, my research has centered on the intersection of deep learning and NLP, striving to develop efficient solutions for complex language challenges. I'm also dedicated to advancing NLP for Spanish and co-official languages in Spain, working on initiatives that bridge linguistic and technological gaps.

Over the years, I've been an active participant in shared tasks across a variety of NLP domains. I was part of the winning teams in several competitions, including TASS [2017](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1896/p2_elirf_tass2017.pdf) to [2020](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2664/tass_paper2.pdf), [IroSVA](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2421/IroSvA_paper_4.pdf), [COSET](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1881/COSET_paper_7.pdf), and [SemEval 2024 Task 8](https://aclanthology.org/2024.semeval-1.17/). I’ve also achieved strong results in other SemEval challenges, such as [2017](https://aclanthology.org/S17-2121/), [2018 (1)](https://aclanthology.org/S18-1159/), [2018 (2)](https://aclanthology.org/S18-1092/), or [2019](https://aclanthology.org/S19-2031/).

In 2023, I began organizing a line of shared tasks at the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF), focusing on machine-generated text detection and attribution, such as [AuTexTification](https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/137177/1/PLN_71_21.pdf), [IberAuTexTification](http://journal.sepln.org/sepln/ojs/ojs/index.php/pln/article/view/6628/4020), and [MIMIC](https://sites.google.com/view/mimic-2025/home). I was also on the [program committee](https://genai-content-detection.gitlab.io/organizers/) for the GenAI content detection task at COLING 2025, and I am one of the three organizers of IberLEF from 2025 to 2027.

Outside of research, I’m passionate about teaching. I currently teach courses on information retrieval, intelligent agents, and programming at Universidad Europea, as well as advanced machine learning techniques in the Master’s in Big Data program at Universidad de Barcelona. Besides, I am a recurrent invited speaker to the Master's in Artificial Intelligence of the UPV to give a [talk about language modeling and embeddings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hu7c4ii-cgSB5SrniTB8l1pLLeaUUaQ/view?usp=sharing).

I'm also proud to share that my PhD thesis was awarded cum laude and received the [best NLP thesis award](http://www.sepln.org/en/research/sepln-award) from the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing.
